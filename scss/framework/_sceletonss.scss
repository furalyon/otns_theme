/*
A base skeleton for stylesheets. It sets up various object abstractions 
and mixins and stays out of the way to let you do the styling yourself.

There wont be a separate documentation, but the code will be heavily documented.

A table of contents will be listed below. Search with $<section-title> to 
get to the section that you need.
